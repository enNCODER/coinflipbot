Welcome to Coin Flip Bot!\
\
With this bot, you can get either heads or tails by just typing !flip.\
Also you can DM the bot instead of posting it in the server and it will
still work!\
Feel free to host the bot yourself!\
This bot was written entirely in
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597188231246000&usg=AOvVaw3Vkta8m8QkPL3QbkYwbx00).\
If you would like to host the bot yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597188231247000&usg=AOvVaw0LnbxtFpbhTOjL0HlNwi3B) and
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597188231247000&usg=AOvVaw0IY46J9P7XL_06JU5RlLGm) installed.
I would also recommend getting [Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597188231247000&usg=AOvVaw0rGv31GZ3XKPlU7JV-U6zd) as
your code editor. \
Make sure to replace\
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client Secret”
with “client.login('your-token-goes-here');” and replace
“your-token-goes-here” with the bot token but do not get rid of the two
' symbols at the beginning and end of the text.\
