Welcome to Coin Flip Bot!\
\
With this bot, you can get either heads or tails by just typing !flip.\
Feel free to host the bot yourself!\
This bot was written entirely in
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597178033250000&usg=AOvVaw3OgoUVwrHYyoJ9V2l-JvzD).\
If you would like to host the bot yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597178033250000&usg=AOvVaw1V8WEqzICwAXgRQm8vWUA_) and

I would also recommend getting [Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597178033250000&usg=AOvVaw1EQGZpJxwJIlBtXfgLOoWs) as
your code editor. \
Make sure to replace\
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client Secret”
with “client.login('your-token-goes-here');” and replace
“your-token-goes-here” with the bot token but do not get rid of the two
' symbols at the beginning and end of the text.\
